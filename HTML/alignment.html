                        Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little
                        exertion. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scavenging, surface seizing, or diving. Albatrosses are colonial,
                        nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males
                        and females form over several years, with the use of "ritualised dances", and last for the life of the pair. A breeding
                        season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt.
