        <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million.
            It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, 
             and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, 
             was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, 
             to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. 
             Since the 19th century, the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core,
             historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,
             which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London, which is governed by 33 local authorities and
             the Greater London Authority.

        <h2>Rome</h2>

            Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, 
            the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia 
            and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated from
            a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom,
            the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis.
            It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La Città Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in
            the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.[12][13] Rome is also called 
            "Caput Mundi"

            of central Italy, formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a republic with a
            government of the Senate and the People. The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours
