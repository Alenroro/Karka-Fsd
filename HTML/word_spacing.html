                Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great
                distances with little exertion. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scavenging, surface 
                seizing, or diving. Albatrosses are colonial, nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands,
                often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years,
                with the use of "ritualised dances", and last for the life of the pair. A breeding season can take 
                over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt.
