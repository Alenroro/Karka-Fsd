            <h2>Cat</h2>
            <p>The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the
                family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the
                wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral
                cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for
                companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
                registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body,
                quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its
                night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</p>
            <p>Cat communication includes vocalizations like
                meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.
                Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e.
                most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such
                as those made by mice and other small mammals.It also secretes and perceives pheromones.
                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from
                two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby
                known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their
                proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide,
                contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.</p>
