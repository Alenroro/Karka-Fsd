        <h1><u>PARIS</u></h1>
        <p>Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,761,632 residents in 2019 
            in an area of more than 105 kmÂ² (41 sq mi), making it the fourth-most populated city in the European Union and 
            the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance,
            diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its very early system of street lighting,
            in the 19th century it became known as "the City of Light". Like London, prior to the Second World War, it was also sometimes called the capital of the world.
           
            Paris hosts several United Nations organisations including UNESCO, and other international organisations 
            such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, 
            the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies 
            such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority or the European Securities and Markets Authority.
