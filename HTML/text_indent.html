                Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover 
                great distances with little exertion. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scavenging,
                surface seizing, or diving. Albatrosses are colonial,nesting for the most part on remote oceanic 
                islands, often with several species nesting together.
