            A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants.
            Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes.The 
            <b>male</b> <i>gametophyte</i>, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte
            is contained within the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called 
            pollination.
